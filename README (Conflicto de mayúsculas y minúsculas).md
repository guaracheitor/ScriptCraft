# Let's begin...

I created ScriptCraft to make it easier for children (and anyone
curious about programming) to create their own Minecraft
Mods. ScriptCraft makes it easier for new programmers to create
Minecraft mods. Mods are written using the Javascript programming
language and once the ScriptCraft mod is installed, you can add your
own new Mods by adding Javascript (.js) files in a directory.

 * If you're new to programming and want to start modding Minecraft, then [Start Here][ypgpm].
 * If you've already used [Scratch][scr], have attended a few [CoderDojo][cd] sessions, or have already dabbled with Javascript, then [Start Here][cda].

# Additional Resources

CoderDojo Athenry have some [excellent tutorials][cda] for younger
programmers who have used [Scratch][scr] and are interested in Modding
Minecraft using Javascript.  In particular, they have an excellent
[Scratch - to - Javascript][sj] tutorial which explains Scratch
programs and how to do the same thing in Javascript.

I highly recommend the series of [tutorials provided by CoderDojo Athenry][cda].

Developer Chris Cacciatore has created some interesting tools using Scriptcraft...
